# Question

`app.get(endpoint, controller)` takes in an `endpoint` as the first argument.

What is an endpoint in Express?

# Answer

An endpoint in Express refers to the URL path address from the home page. This specific path serves as the route for the specific HTTP method to be enacted upon. The endpoint could contain dynamic parameters, which is represented with `:`. Lastly, a fallback of the endpoint is `*`, which serves as a catch all for the endpoints that are not defined.
