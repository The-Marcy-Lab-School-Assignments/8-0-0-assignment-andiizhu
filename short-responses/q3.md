# Question

`app.get(endpoint, controller)` takes in a `controller` as the second argument.

What is a controller?

# Answer

The controller is the callback function that is used to store the logic that is invoked when the endpoint is hit. Express invokes the controller that contains request and response parameters. The request is process and a response is generated. Lastly, if the controllers is middleware, it would also include `next` in order to finish the operation and pass to the next function.
